# System Implementation

## Core Backend Implementation

1. Service Layer Architecture
* Clean separation between API, business logic, and data access
* Provider abstractions for easy switching between data sources and LLM services
* Type-safe implementation with comprehensive error handling
* Structured logging with observability from day one

2. Core Django Apps
* apps.common: Shared utilities, exceptions, structured logging
* apps.businesses: Business profile models and data management
* apps.comparisons: Core comparison logic, services, and API endpoints
