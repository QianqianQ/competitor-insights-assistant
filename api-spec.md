Okay, I will generate two API endpoint specifications based on the user stories and the provided template. The first will be for initiating a comparison, and the second will be for searching for businesses (useful for selecting competitors).

**Endpoint: Create Business Profile Comparison**

- **Purpose:**
    - Initiates a comparison between a user's specified business profile and one or more competitor business profiles. It fetches data for all businesses, performs an attribute comparison, and uses an LLM to generate a summary and improvement suggestions. The full comparison report is returned.
- **HTTP Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/api/v1/comparisons`
- **Parameters:**
    - **Path Parameters:** None
    - **Query Parameters:** None
    - **Request Body:**
        - JSON object containing:
            - `user_business_identifier` (string, required): The name or website URL of the user's business.
            - `competitor_identifiers` (array of strings, required, min items: 1): An array of names or website URLs for the competitor businesses.
            - `options` (object, optional):
                - `mock_data` (boolean, optional, default: false): If true, forces the backend to use mocked data for external API calls (Serper.dev, LLM) for testing or demo purposes.
- **Response (Success):**
    - **Status Code:** `201 Created`
    - **Body:** A JSON object representing the comparison report:
        ```json
        {
          "report_id": "comp_rpt_xyz123abc", // Unique identifier for the generated report
          "user_business": {
            "name": "User's Restaurant Name",
            "identifier_used": "user-restaurant.com", // The identifier provided in the request
            "attributes": {
              "review_count": 150,
              "average_rating": 4.5,
              "number_of_images": 25,
              "has_hours": true,
              "has_description": true,
              "has_menu_link": true
              // Potentially other fetched attributes
            },
            "profile_data_source": "serper.dev" // Or "mock"
          },
          "competitors": [
            {
              "name": "Competitor A Name",
              "identifier_used": "competitorA.com",
              "attributes": {
                "review_count": 200,
                "average_rating": 4.3,
                "number_of_images": 15,
                "has_hours": true,
                "has_description": false,
                "has_menu_link": true
                // Potentially other fetched attributes
              },
              "profile_data_source": "serper.dev" // Or "mock"
            }
            // ... more competitors
          ],
          "ai_comparison_summary": "Your restaurant shows strong ratings but could improve image count compared to competitors...",
          "ai_improvement_suggestions": [
            "Add at least 10 more photos to your profile.",
            "Ensure your business description is comprehensive and engaging."
          ],
          "created_at": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z" // ISO 8601 timestamp
        }
        ```
- **Response (Error):**
    - **Status Codes:**
        - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input (e.g., missing required fields, malformed identifiers, too many competitors if a limit is set).
        - `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid JWT token.
        - `402 Payment Required`: If API usage hits a quota and requires payment/upgrade (less common for MVP internal tools unless external APIs are costly and passed on).
        - `404 Not Found`: If one or more specified businesses (user's or competitor's) cannot be found/resolved by the external data provider.
        - `500 Internal Server Error`: General server-side error, or error communicating with LLM/external data APIs.
        - `503 Service Unavailable`: External service (LLM, Serper.dev) is temporarily down or unreachable.
    - **Body (Optional):** Standardized JSON object:
        ```json
        {
          "error": {
            "type": "Validation Error", // e.g., "AuthenticationError", "ExternalAPIError", "NotFoundError"
            "message": "Descriptive error message.",
            "details": { /* Optional: more specific error details */ }
          }
        }
        ```
- **Authentication/Authorization:**
    - Requires an authenticated user session (JWT passed in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header). This is to potentially associate reports with users (future), apply rate limits, or manage API key usage for external services tied to users/tenants.
- **Notes/Considerations:**
    - The process of fetching data for multiple businesses and then calling an LLM can be time-consuming. For MVP, this might be synchronous. For future enhancements, consider an asynchronous pattern: the `POST` could return `202 Accepted` with a `report_id` and a status link, and the client would poll a `GET /api/v1/comparisons/{report_id}` endpoint.
    - Input validation for business identifiers (URL format, name length) is crucial.
    - Error handling needs to be robust, especially for external API failures (Serper.dev, LLM).
    - The backend will need logic to resolve string identifiers (name/URL) to actual business profiles via the external data API.
    - Consider caching results from external data APIs (like Serper.dev) to reduce costs and latency, respecting their terms of service.
    - The structure of `attributes` within the response should be consistent for the user's business and competitors.

**Endpoint: Search for Businesses**

- **Purpose:**
    - Allows a user to search for businesses by name or keyword, optionally constrained by location (if location data is available/relevant for search). This helps users find and select their own business or competitor businesses.
- **HTTP Method:** `GET`
- **Path:** `/api/v1/businesses/search`
- **Parameters:**
    - **Path Parameters:** None
    - **Query Parameters:**
        - `query` (string, required): The search term (e.g., business name, keyword like "pizza place").
        - `location` (string, optional): A textual representation of the location to narrow down the search (e.g., "San Francisco, CA", "near me" - latter requires frontend to resolve location).
        - `limit` (integer, optional, default: 10): Maximum number of results to return.
    - **Request Body:** None (as it's a `GET` request)
- **Response (Success):**
    - **Status Code:** `200 OK`
    - **Body:** A JSON object containing a list of found businesses:
        ```json
        {
          "search_query": "User's query string",
          "results": [
            {
              "id": "biz_gplace_123", // A unique identifier from the source (e.g., Google Place ID) or internal
              "name": "Found Business Name 1",
              "address": "123 Main St, Anytown, USA", // Or a formatted address string
              "website_url": "http://foundbusiness1.com", // If available
              "data_source_identifier": "ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4" // e.g. Google Place ID
            },
            {
              "id": "biz_gplace_456",
              "name": "Found Business Name 2",
              "address": "456 Oak Ave, Anytown, USA",
              "website_url": "http://foundbusiness2.com",
              "data_source_identifier": "ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY5"
            }
            // ... up to 'limit' results
          ],
          "total_results_approx": 25, // Approximate total if more than limit
          "data_source": "serper.dev" // Or "mock"
        }
        ```
- **Response (Error):**
    - **Status Codes:**
        - `400 Bad Request`: Missing `query` parameter or invalid parameter values.
        - `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid JWT token (if this endpoint is not public).
        - `500 Internal Server Error`: General server-side error or error communicating with the external search API.
        - `503 Service Unavailable`: External search service is temporarily down.
    - **Body (Optional):** Standardized JSON object:
        ```json
        {
          "error": {
            "type": "ValidationError",
            "message": "Query parameter is required."
          }
        }
        ```
- **Authentication/Authorization:**
    - Could be publicly accessible or require an authenticated user session (JWT). If using a paid external search API (like Serper.dev), requiring authentication helps in rate-limiting and cost control per user. For an MVP focusing on a single user experience, JWT authentication is recommended to align with other authenticated parts of the application.
- **Notes/Considerations:**
    - The quality and relevance of search results depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying external API (e.g., Serper.dev for Google Search results).
    - If `location` is "near me", the frontend would need to get geolocation permissions and pass coordinates or a resolved textual location to the backend. The backend might not directly handle "near me".
    - The `id` returned for each business should be usable by the `POST /api/v1/comparisons` endpoint if the user selects it, or the frontend can just use the `name` or `website_url` from the search result as an identifier. Using a `data_source_identifier` (like Google Place ID) can be more robust for fetching precise data in the comparison step.
    - Pagination might be needed if a large number of results are possible (e.g., using `offset` or cursor-based pagination), but for MVP, a simple `limit` is often sufficient.
    - Clearly define what fields constitute a "match" for the search query (name, category, description, etc.) based on the external API's capabilities.

**Reasoning for Design Choices:**

1.  **Endpoint: Create Business Profile Comparison (`POST /api/v1/comparisons`)**
    *   **HTTP Method (`POST`):** This endpoint creates a new resource (a `ComparisonReport`) and has side effects (fetching data, LLM calls). `POST` is the appropriate verb for resource creation and actions that are not idempotent in the same way `PUT` is for updates.
    *   **Path (`/api/v1/comparisons`):** Follows RESTful conventions using a plural noun (`comparisons`) for the collection of resources. Versioning (`v1`) is included for future API evolution.
    *   **Request Body:**
        *   `user_business_identifier` and `competitor_identifiers`: These directly map to the user stories requiring the user to input their business and competitor details (User Stories 1 & 2 inputs, User Story 3 action). Using string identifiers (name/URL) aligns with the "allow the user to enter a business name or website" requirement and simplifies the MVP.
        *   `options.mock_data`: Added for practical testing and development, as per the assignment's allowance for mocked data.
    *   **Response (`201 Created`):** Standard success code for resource creation. The response body includes the newly created report, providing immediate feedback and data for the frontend, which aligns with User Stories 4, 5, and 6 (viewing comparison, summary, and suggestions).
    *   **Response Body Structure:** Designed to be comprehensive, providing all necessary data for the frontend to render the comparison results without further calls for this immediate flow. It clearly separates the user's business, competitors, and AI-generated insights. Including `report_id` allows for future retrieval or referencing.
    *   **Authentication (JWT):** Aligns with the frontend authentication strategy mentioned in the problem description. Essential for any stateful interaction or if user-specific data/limits are involved.
    *   **Error Handling:** Includes common HTTP error codes relevant to API interactions, external service dependencies, and input validation. A structured error response aids client-side error handling.
    *   **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous:** For MVP simplicity and a 1-2 day timeline, a synchronous response is chosen. The note acknowledges the potential need for an async pattern for scalability.

2.  **Endpoint: Search for Businesses (`GET /api/v1/businesses/search`)**
    *   **HTTP Method (`GET`):** This endpoint retrieves a list of resources (businesses matching search criteria) without side effects, making `GET` the appropriate method.
    *   **Path (`/api/v1/businesses/search`):** Uses a clear, descriptive path indicating a search operation on the `businesses` resource collection.
    *   **Query Parameters:**
        *   `query`: Essential for any search functionality.
        *   `location`: Addresses the "optionally, let the user select nearby" aspect of competitor selection.
        *   `limit`: Basic pagination for controlling response size.
    *   **Response (`200 OK`):** Standard success code for `GET` requests that return data.
    *   **Response Body Structure:** Returns a list of `results` with key information for each business, allowing the user to identify and select them. Includes `data_source_identifier` which can be a more stable way to reference businesses in subsequent API calls (like the comparison endpoint).
    *   **Authentication (JWT Recommended):** While search *could* be public, tying it to an authenticated user helps manage API usage costs for external services (like Serper.dev) and apply consistent rate limiting.
    *   **Purpose Alignment:** Directly supports the user story of identifying/selecting competitor businesses by providing a search mechanism, as suggested by the "Optionally, let the user select nearby or similar competitors" requirement.
    *   **Data Source Identifier:** Including `data_source_identifier` (e.g., Google Place ID from Serper.dev) in the search results is a good practice. If the user selects a business from these results, this identifier can be passed to the "Create Comparison" endpoint. This is more reliable than just a name, as names might not be unique.

**General OpenAPI/RESTful Principles Applied:**
*   **Resource-Oriented Paths:** Using nouns to represent resources (e.g., `/comparisons`, `/businesses`).
*   **Standard HTTP Methods:** Correctly using `GET` for retrieval and `POST` for creation/action.
*   **Standard HTTP Status Codes:** Employing appropriate codes for success and various error conditions.
*   **Versioning:** Including `/v1/` in the path for API evolution.
*   **JSON for Data Exchange:** Using JSON for request and response bodies, a common standard for web APIs.
*   **Clear Parameter Usage:** Differentiating between path, query, and body parameters.
*   **Authentication:** Considering JWT as specified for frontend interaction.
*   **Idempotency Considerations:** `GET` is inherently idempotent. `POST` for creation is typically not idempotent (multiple calls create multiple resources).
</reasoning>
